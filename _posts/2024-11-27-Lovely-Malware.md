Writeup for the insane difficulty Malware/RE sherlock "Lovely Malware" found [here](https://app.hackthebox.com/sherlocks/Lovely%20Malware)

**Challenge description:** *An employee at NeirCyber Security discovered a suspicious file named employee_benefits.exe on their desktop. The employee found the file after returning from lunch and immediately reported it to the IT security team, suspecting that it could be malicious. The objective is to reverse engineer the file and dissect its inner workings.*

**Will release this once the sherlock is retired** as per [guidelines](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/5188925-streaming-writeups-walkthrough-guidelines)
